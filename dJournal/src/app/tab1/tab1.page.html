          This is me performing my own song "Solace" on my guitar. It's one of the first pieces I wrote on guitar and I think it sounds pretty metal.

          This is an amazing picture of the crowd that I performed in front of during New Year's Day. I had the chance to play my own songs and the audience received it nicely.
          This makes me super happy and motivated for the future!

          I had the chance to perform on a New Year's Day show in Kozani in front of a lot of people. I played some of my own songs and the audience received them very well.
          That makes me really happy and motivated for the future! Can't wait for more.

          Last night I played on a Christmas live show. It was a gret experience. I played a lot of good music from all different genres, Techno, House and EDMM.
          It was an epic experience and I wish to repeat it soon.

          I just arrived in Amsterdam to attend the Amsterdam Dance Event (ADE). I will be playing a show in front of 1500 people.
          I will also be meeting a lot of interesting individuals, make connections and talk about music production and djing with people from the industry.
          It's going to be great!

        <ion-card-content>
          I just signed my first track on a major record label, Spinnin Records. I am super proud of this!
          This song is about the jungles of Myanmar, hence I named the song "MYANMAR". My dream is starting to take flesh and bone.
